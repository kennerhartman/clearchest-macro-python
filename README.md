# Overview

Once ran, this Python script is always active unless you terminate the script or press ```Shift + ESC```.  When ```Left Shift + b``` is pressed, you will empty out the entire chest/shulker box.  When ```Left Shift + ` ```is pressed, you will empty out one line in the chest/shulker box.

I originally had this idea programmed in the LUA scripting language to work with my Logitech G-502 mouse, but I wanted to expand compatibility to my non-Logitech keyboard.
