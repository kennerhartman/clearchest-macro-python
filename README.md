# Overview

Once ran, this Python script is always active unless you terminate the script or press ```Shift + ESC```.  

Once ran, this Python script is always active unless you terminate the script or press ```L SHIFT + ESC```.  
- When ```L SHIFT + b``` is pressed, you will empty out the entire chest/shulker box.  
- When ```L SHIFT + ` ```is pressed, you will empty out one line in the chest/shulker box.

- When ``` L CTRL + L SHIFT + a``` is pressed, you can change how many lines you clear from a chest/shulker.  Default times is 3.  You will need to manually activate the terminal window to type in a value.  If you enter a string, you will be prompted to press ```L CTRL + L SHIFT + a``` again to change how many lines you clear from a chest/shulker.

    - <span style="color: lightblue">Upon entering a value, the script will "remember" your input so when you close the script and later reopen it, it will still use the value you inputted.  There is no need to create a ```config.json``` file; that is handled by the script.</span>

I originally had this idea programmed in the LUA scripting language to work with my Logitech G-502 mouse, but I wanted to expand compatibility to my non-Logitech keyboard.

# Modules Used 

- [```mouse```](https://pypi.org/project/mouse/): receives mouse inputs, emulates mouse inputs, receives cursor position, and sets cursor position
- [```keyboard```](https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/): receives keyboard inputs and emulates keyboard inputs
- [```pygetwindow```](https://pypi.org/project/PyGetWindow/): for this script, allows the script to access Windows processes and know what Window is active

Built-in Python Libraries:

- ```time```: suspend script execution
- ```json```: read and write to json files
- ```os```: used to create a ```config.json``` file and append data, if not present
